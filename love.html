                <p class="txt-l">The Radha- Krishna entanglement was such a pure and mythical tale. Wasn‚Äôt it? Even today, this amour stands as one of the most adulated stories of all time
                    Krishna, the 8th incarnation behind Vishnu, is the Supreme Power of all Gods. Being such a powerful God, you must have thought that he wouldn‚Äôt have time for love. Today you are going to read an amazing love story of Radha & Krishna.
                    
                    But hey folks, you won‚Äôt believe that Krishna had almost 16,000 to 16,100 wives! Incredible. Isn‚Äôt it?
                    Well, he had thousands of wives but his heart ached only for Radha. Lord Krishna‚Äôs devotees are increasing day by day. 
                    
                    It is believed that he is still present on earth as ‚ÄúKhatu Shyam‚Äù, which is a very famous temple of an avatar of Lord Krishna in Rajasthan, India. You can find so many conversations ‚ÄúSamvad‚Äù of Lord Krishna in the holy book, ‚ÄúShrimad Bhagvat Geeta‚Äô.
                    
                    In this holy book, Lord Krishna had given so many life lessons that once anybody reads it, they will just get so spiritual and amazed by it!</p>

                    When Krishna was a small little lad, he would go by the lake, in Gokul, and start playing the flute for the grazing cows.
                    One would say he became the best flute player due to the daily playing of the flute!

                    Lord Krishna‚Äôs flute sound was so melodious and was like magic for all! The time sound gets into anybody‚Äôs ear it would just make them dive into Lord Krishna‚Äôs devotion.<br>
                    As he played so brilliantly just as a virtuoso, all the cowgirls and Gopis stopped their work, flocked and dance around him. Thousands of Gopis would run up to Krishna, while playing the flute, and would try to woo him.<br>
                    (He had monsoon-blue skin, almond-shaped eyes, lotus-pink lips, curly black hair, a chiselled body, and a few peacock feathers in his hair to tie up the look) Krishna was a nasty little fellow during his youth. Many young girls wanted him as their better half, but Krishna‚Äôs heart yearned for Radha.<br>
                    There is a book called ‚ÄúRadha Chalisa‚Äù in which it was mentioned that Radha was one of the most important Gopi in Raas (Sacred Dance). She is also called ‚ÄúRadharani‚Äù, ‚ÄúRadhe‚Äù and ‚ÄúRadhika‚Äù.

                    Radha had the purest of hearts. One would say that she looked more gorgeous than Krishna. Her dance to the music of the flute of Krishna made him fall in love with her even more. In this way, Radha & Krishna‚Äôs love blossomed.

                <p class="txt-m">
                    However, this love story never reached its maturity because Krishna left Vrindavan at the age of 12 to study at his Gurukul.
                    As she was getting younger Radha‚Äôs parents‚Äô concern for her marriage got increased. That‚Äôs why she was married to another man.

                    Meanwhile, Radha was married off to a wealthy landowner named Abhimanyu. As she was getting young.

                    You know, the truth was that Lord Krishna and Radha married once in their childhood but it was in a fun way! Though the marriage was playfully done! But, Radha devoted herself completely to Lord Krishna.

                    Lord Krishna and Radha were not bound in holy matrimony and yet they were soulmates.

                    As Radha was also married, she tried to cease the feelings she had for Krishna, but in vain. Nevertheless, she accepted her devotion to Krishna.<br>
                    As Radha was deeply devoted to Krishna, Radha Krishna is taken as the relationship between a devotee and God.

                    Radha thought about Krishna each second of her life. Krishna on the other hand was a King and had duties to fulfill. He was sent on earth to teach everyone about life! But, he only got to learn so many things.

                    Indeed he was an incarnation with a purpose to complete!<br>
                    He never married Radha and was not able to meet her after he left Gokul and became King. Radha and Krishna though are two different names, but they are just so darn in love with each other that both their names have combined into one; now isn‚Äôt that just admiring?!
                    <br>
                    Lord Krishna & Radha‚Äôs relationship a proof that true love does not mean marriage<br>
                    According to the Vedas, Krishna believed that Love doesn‚Äôt require marriage. Marriage is an agreement and Love is a selfless, pure emotion shares by two lovers.

                    Love is True. Love is Pure.
